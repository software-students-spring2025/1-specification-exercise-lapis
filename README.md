## User Requirements

- As a job seeker, I want to upload my resume once and have the system automatically pick up my tech stack, project experience, and years of experience, so it can recommend more accurate and relevant interview questions that match my background.

- As a job seeker, I want to paste the job description (including requirements and responsibilities) of my target role into the system, so it can generate tailored interview questions based on those needs. This way, I can practice more efficiently for that specific role.

- As a job seeker, I want to customize the types and difficulty levels of interview questions based on my needs, like focusing only on algorithm questions or behavioral interviews, so I can quickly strengthen my weak areas in a short time.

- As a job seeker, I want to answer questions in text, audio, or video formats. This will help me get used to real interview scenarios and allow me to review my performance to make improvements.

- As a job seeker, I want to get immediate scoring and brief feedback after answering each question, so I can quickly identify the strengths and weaknesses in my responses and improve on the spot.

- As a job seeker, I want to see supplementary materials or quick hint links when viewing questions. This way, I can dig deeper into related knowledge, industry context, or best practices instead of relying solely on memory.

- As a job seeker, I want the system to save all my practice answers and feedback records, so I can review my past responses and compare how I’ve improved over time.

- As a job seeker, I want to see visual stats on my dashboard, like average scores, accuracy trends, and response times. This will help me clearly understand my preparation progress and keep me motivated to keep going.

- As a job seeker, I want to experience different types of interview simulations in the system, like technical interviews, behavioral interviews, or case interviews. This will help me practice communication and problem-solving approaches for different formats before the real thing.

- As a job seeker, I want to receive personalized suggestions from the system after some practice, like “You’ve improved a lot on algorithm questions—try more advanced ones” or “You’re missing concrete examples in behavioral interviews.” This will help me focus on areas that need more work.
