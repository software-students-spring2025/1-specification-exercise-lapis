## Stakeholders
our stakeholder for the interview is a computer science student in NYU. He is about to graduate and is preparing for software development or data-related job interviews. He really need some help.

His Struggle:
It is difficult to practice in a personalized manner for different positions or interview types, making it hard to quickly address weak areas.

There is a lack of real-time, professional feedback, so he is unsure about the strengths and weaknesses of his responses.

There is no readily available learning material or background information, causing significant time spent on research and organization.

There is no systematic progress tracking or data visualization, making it difficult to measure improvement and maintain motivation.

His goal:
Automate resume parsing so that once a resume is uploaded, the system can automatically pick relevant interview questions for the user.

Provide tailored interview questions based on the job description (JD), allowing more targeted practice.

Support response formats like text, audio, video and simulate different interview scenarios like technical, behavioral, case studies.

Store all practice answers and feedback, with charts and trend analysis to clearly show progress and maintain motivation.

## Product Vision Statement

we want an all-in-one interview preperation tool that automatically tailors questions to your resume and target role, gives you instant feedback in text, audio, or video, and tracks your progress—so you can focus on practicing your skills and landing the job you want.

## User Requirements

- As a job seeker, I want to upload my resume once and have the system automatically pick up my tech stack, project experience, and years of experience, so it can recommend more accurate and relevant interview questions that match my background.

- As a job seeker, I want to paste the job description (including requirements and responsibilities) of my target role into the system, so it can generate tailored interview questions based on those needs. This way, I can practice more efficiently for that specific role.

- As a job seeker, I want to customize the types and difficulty levels of interview questions based on my needs, like focusing only on algorithm questions or behavioral interviews, so I can quickly strengthen my weak areas in a short time.

- As a job seeker, I want to answer questions in text, audio, or video formats. This will help me get used to real interview scenarios and allow me to review my performance to make improvements.

- As a job seeker, I want to get immediate scoring and brief feedback after answering each question, so I can quickly identify the strengths and weaknesses in my responses and improve on the spot.

- As a job seeker, I want to see supplementary materials or quick hint links when viewing questions. This way, I can dig deeper into related knowledge, industry context, or best practices instead of relying solely on memory.

- As a job seeker, I want the system to save all my practice answers and feedback records, so I can review my past responses and compare how I’ve improved over time.

- As a job seeker, I want to see visual stats on my dashboard, like average scores, accuracy trends, and response times. This will help me clearly understand my preparation progress and keep me motivated to keep going.

- As a job seeker, I want to experience different types of interview simulations in the system, like technical interviews, behavioral interviews, or case interviews. This will help me practice communication and problem-solving approaches for different formats before the real thing.

- As a job seeker, I want to receive personalized suggestions from the system after some practice, like “You’ve improved a lot on algorithm questions—try more advanced ones” or “You’re missing concrete examples in behavioral interviews.” This will help me focus on areas that need more work.
